                problem: 'Tuberculosis is a top 10 leading cause of death by infection. Spread by respiratory droplets, it\'s highly contagious. Luckily, TB is highly treatable. However, treatment is a long process, taking upwards of six months. The side effects of medication often feel worse than the infectionâ€™s symptoms, discouraging patients from completing treatment. As a result, patients may remain contagious and even develop a drug-resistant TB strain.',

                    'Allow patients to track their medication intake and providers to monitor treatment progress, verified by use of test strips.',
